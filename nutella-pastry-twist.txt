Nutella Pastry Twist

Ingredients:
1 large jar Nutella
2 boxes puff pastry sheets
milk or egg

Steps:
1. Layer the 4 puff pastry sheets on a baking sheet with Nutella between each (you may want to use a piping bag to apply the Nutella, since it does not like being spread on pastry, for some reason).
2. Cut 1 inch strips from two opposing edges towards the middle, but stop about an inch short of the center, so you have a central trunk with multiple strips radiating out in both directions.
3. Twist each of the strips twice and press the end flat on the baking sheet to make it stay. You can alternate the twist directions to create interesting patterns if you like.
4. Cut some small slits into the trunk of the pastry to help cook the middle at a similar rate to the strips.
5. Brush the top of the pastry with milk or egg as a glaze.
6. Bake at 350F for 20-25 minutes, or until all the pastry has puffed up and is starting to turn golden-brown.
7. Serve warm with a glass of milk. Tear off the strips by hand!
